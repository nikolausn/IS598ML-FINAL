That means that $ V_\\\\varepsilon $\\nis a sum of a slowly varying potential, $ W_0 ( x) $, and one oscillating at\\nfrequency $1/\\\\varepsilon$. For $ W_0 \\\\equiv 0 $ we prove that there are no\\nresonances above the line $\\\\text{Im} \\\\lambda = -A \\\\ln(\\\\varepsilon^{-1})$,\\nexcept possibly a simple resonance of modulus $\\\\sim \\\\varepsilon^2$, when $\\nd=1$. We show that this result is optimal by constructing a one-dimensional\\nexample. In the case when $ W_0 \\\\neq 0 $ we prove that resonances in fixed\\nstrips admit an expansion in powers of $\\\\varepsilon$. The argument provides a\\nmethod for computing the coefficients of the expansion. In particular we\\nproduce an effective potential converging uniformly to $W_0$ as $\\\\varepsilon\\n\\\\rightarrow 0$ and whose resonances approach resonances of $V_\\\\varepsilon$\\nmodulo $O(\\\\varepsilon^4)$.\\n</abstract></arXiv>\\n\\n'\n"
